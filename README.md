## Personal Portfolio - Vandana Munjal
User Experience/ Product Designer

It is me, Vandana, aka Vinni - your friendly neighborhood product designer. Hailing all the way from India, on a mission to discover the wonders of User Experience Design and Research.

As an artist&engineer, I paint, doodle, do embroidery, macrame, know pottery, and can build a backend/frontend and manage the entire product lifecycle.
